Fuel Injection Service
======================

Your vehicle's fuel injection system helps your car make effective and efficient use of gasoline by ensuring that it will combust. In order to accomplish this, it must mix gasoline and air at a certain ratio and deliver it at the correct timings.

When this system stumbles, your vehicle could have problems getting started or struggle with getting up to speed on the roads. It also means that you're wasting gasoline and money, and this can add up over time. Properly maintaining your fuel injection system can save you a lot of money in the long run as well as help keep your car or truck running at peak performance.

Our fuel system repair services include:

* Lines
* Diagnosis
* Pumps
* Filters
* Tanks
* Hoses

Gas prices at the pump are pushing towards an all-time high. Let Princess Anne Auto help ensure that you're getting the most bang for the buck out of your gasoline. Give us a call at 858-0744, or just swing on by the shop!
