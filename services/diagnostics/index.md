Computer Diagnostics
====================

Is your "Engine Light" on? Let us help.

Modern automotives use a system of sensors to track many of critical components required to keep your vehicle running safely and comfortably.

Our computer diagnostics system allows us to interface with your vehicle's sensor system, which gives us valuable information regarding everything from air conditioning to transmission(and much, much more).

Our diagnostics system allows us to quickly troubleshoot many common issues, giving our experienced technicians more time to *fix* the problem with your car or truck.

So what does this mean for you? Savings on labor costs!

Call us today at 858-0744 to schedule an appointment (or just come on by our shop!), and let us diagnose whatever is ailing your car.
