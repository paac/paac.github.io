Oil Changes
===========

One of the most basic needs for any engine-propelled vehicle is maintaining its oil. Oil lubricates your engine's moving parts, reducing friction and preventing damage from moisture and corrosive chemicals. Changing your oil regularly will ensure that your engine stays clear of buildup, which lowers fuel efficiency and can take years off of the life of your car or truck. In other words, a simple oil change a few times a year can save you hundreds of dollars in the long term.

Our Oil & Filter Service includes:

* Up to five quarts of premium, synthetic blend oil
* Oil filter replacement
* Chassis lubrication (if needed)
* Tire pressure check
* Fluid check
* Safety check
