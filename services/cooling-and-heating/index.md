Cooling and Heating Systems Service
===================================
					
Gasoline-powered engines generate a *lot* of heat. A hot engine runs more efficiently than a cold engine, but if your car is generating too much heat, you run the risk of overheating, which can result in catastrophic damages, not to mention expensive repairs.

A properly functioning cooling system helps ensure that your vehicle reaches its optimal temperature quickly and *stays* there.

If you suspect that you're having problems with your cooling system, we can help.

Our Cooling and Heating services include:

* Air Conditioning Service
* Hoses
* Belts
* Radiators
* Diagnosis
* Thermostats
* Electric Fans
* Transmission Coolers
* Fan Clutches
* Water Pumps

Call us at 858-0744 to schedule an appointment(or just come on by!) and let us help you keep your automotive running at its best.
