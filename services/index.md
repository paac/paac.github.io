			<h1 class="page-header">Computer Diagnostics</h1>

			<p class="lead">Is your "Engine Light" on? Let us help.</p>

			<p>Modern automotives use a system of sensors to track many of critical components required to keep your vehicle running safely and comfortably.</p>

			<p>Our computer diagnostics system allows us to interface with your vehicle's sensor system, which gives us valuable information regarding everything from air conditioning to transmission(and much, much more).</p>

			<p>Our diagnostics system allows us to quickly troubleshoot many common issues, giving our experienced technicians more time to <em>fix</em> the problem with your car or truck.</p>

			<p>So what does this mean for you? Savings on labor costs!</p>

		<div id="tune-ups">
			<h1 class="page-header">Tune-Ups</h1>

			<p class="lead">Your car or truck is a complicated machine, and it may need some preventative maintainence in order to ensure that it is running optimally, efficiently and safely.</p>
			<p>Regular tuneups help prevent expensive, catastrophic car problems from cropping up, and can add years to the life of your vehicle.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="air-conditioning">
			<h1 class="page-header">Air Conditioning</h1>

			<p>If your air conditioning isn't working as well as it used to, let our team of experienced autmotive technicians help.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="oil-changes">
			<h1 class="page-header">Oil Changes</h1>

			<p class="lead">One of the most basic needs for any engine-propelled vehicle is maintaining its oil. Oil lubricates your engine's moving parts, reducing friction and preventing damage from moisture and corrosive chemicals.</p>
			<p>Changing your oil regularly will ensure that your engine stays clear of buildup, which lowers fuel efficiency and can take years off of the life of your car or truck. In other words, a simple oil change a few times a year can save you hundreds of dollars in the long term.</p>

			<p>Our Oil &amp; Filter Service includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Up to five quarts of premium, synthetic blend oil</li>
				<li>Oil filter replacement</li>

				<li>Fluid check</li>

		<div id="steering-and-suspension">
			<h1 class="page-header">Steering and Suspension</h1>

			<p class="lead">Steering and suspension problems are some of the most noticeable issues for many drivers.</p>
			<p>Steering problems can make a vehicle  seem to "pull" to one side of the road or feel "shakey" at high speeds.</p>
			<p>These same problems can also cause premature wear on your tires, so fixing steering and suspension issues can not only make your car or truck drive more comfortably and safely, it can actually save you money.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="transmission-service">
			<h1 class="page-header">Transmission Repair and Service</h1>

			<h1 class="page-header">Radiator Repair and Service</h1>

			<p class="lead">Breakdowns are often caused by a failing radiator.</p>
			<p>Your radiator helps keep your vehicle's running temperatures low. When it fails, your vehicle overheats, which can result in major expenses.</p>

		</div>
		<div id="fuel-injection-service">
			<h1 class="page-header">Fuel Injection Service</h1>

			<p class="lead">Your vehicle's fuel injection system helps your car make effective and efficient use of gasoline by ensuring that it will combust.</p>
			<p>In order to accomplish this, it must mix gasoline and air at a certain ratio and deliver it at the correct timings.</p>

			<p>When this system stumbles, your vehicle could have problems getting started or struggle with getting up to speed on the roads. It also means that you're wasting gasoline and money, and this can add up over time. Properly maintaining your fuel injection system can save you a lot of money in the long run as well as help keep your car or truck running at peak performance.</p>
