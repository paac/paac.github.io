	<p class="lead">It was kind of a long time coming, but Summer is <em>finally</em> here! It's time for some fun in the sun &emdash; we're planning to check out Norfolk's <a href="http://www.festevents.org/mini-site/norfolk-harborfest">Harbourfest</a>, taking a stroll down the Virginia Beach Boardwalk for the annual <a href="http://virginiamoca.org/outdoor-art-shows/boardwalk-art-show">Boardwalk Art Show &amp; Festival</a>, hitting up some farmer's markets on weekends, maybe even taking a road trip or two.</p>

	<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a true summer in Norfolk without heinous humidity and thermometer-busting temperatures, both of which can take a toll on the performance, driveability, longevity and comfort-level of your vehicle. Trust us, it doesn't get much hotter than being stranded with a broken down car on the side of the Interstate waiting for a tow truck in the middle of summer.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, Princess Anne Auto can help you beat the sizzling summer heat. Come in now and take advantage of our Summer Maintenance package!</p>

			<li>We'll ensure that your vehicle's AC is blowing crisp, cool air.</li>
			<li>Since heat causes gas to expand, tires tend to become overinflated in high temperatures, so we'll make sure they're at the ideal pressure for the season, and we'll go ahead rotate them while we're at it.</li>
			<li>People tend to drive more in the summer, so it's important that your vehicle is prepared for some heavy driving. To help ensure this, we'll change your oil and oil filter, top off the rest of your fluids, and lubricate your chassis.</li>
			<li>Excessive heat is an engine's worst enemy, so we'll make sure that your car or truck is well-equipped to resist overheating. Something as minor as a loose clamp can make all the difference, so we'll inspect all of your hoses and belts and check to make sure your vehicle's engine cooling system is in prime condition.</li>
